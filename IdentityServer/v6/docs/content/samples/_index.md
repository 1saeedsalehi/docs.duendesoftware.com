# Samples

We have a collection of runnable samples for various scenarios. Each sample typically self contained with both an IdentityServer instance and
clients/APIs needed to demonstrate the functionality.

{{%children style="li" /%}}

The source code for the samples are in our samples [repository]({{< param samples_base >}}).

Feel free to open a new Bff or IdentityServer [issue ](https://github.com/DuendeSoftware/Support/issues/new/choose) if you are looking for a particular sample, and can't find it here.
