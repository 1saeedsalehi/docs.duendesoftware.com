This upgrade guide covers upgrading from Duende IdentityServer v6.1 to v6.2 ([release notes](https://github.com/DuendeSoftware/IdentityServer/releases/tag/6.2.0)).

## What's New
Duende IdentityServer 6.2 adds: 
- Support for .NET 7.0
- A new option that can help filter unhandled exceptions out of the logs
- Bug fixes and ongoing maintenance

There are no changes to the data stores in this release.

## Step 1: Update NuGet package

In your IdentityServer host project, update the version of the NuGet. 
For example in your project file:

```
<PackageReference Include="Duende.IdentityServer" Version="6.1.0" />
```

would change to: 

```
<PackageReference Include="Duende.IdentityServer" Version="6.2.0" />
```

## Step 2: Done!

That's it. Of course, at this point you can and should test that your IdentityServer is updated and working properly.
