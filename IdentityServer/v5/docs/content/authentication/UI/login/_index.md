# Login

The purpose of the login page is to allow a user to establish an authentication session in your IdentityServer.
This involves the user presenting credentials and then a session can be established.

## Credentials

Your requirements dictate what types of credentials are allowed in your login workflow.
A common approach is to allow local logins whereby the user enters their credentials into the login page.
An example of that is shown [here]({{<ref "./local">}}).

A user can authenticate by other means, though.
For example a user can utilize an external login system, such as a social login or a federated login provider.
Using an external login is discussed in more detail here [here]({{<ref "./external">}}).

One less common scenario, but still certainly possible, is to allow users to login with integrated Windows authentication, 
which is covered [here]({{<ref "./windows">}}).

## Authentication Session

Regardless of how the user proves their identity on the login page, an authentication session must be established.
This authentication session is based on ASP.NET Coreâ€™s authentication system, and is tracked with a cookie managed by the [cookie authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/cookie) handler.

To establish the session, ASP.NET Core provides a *SignInAsync* extension method on the *HttpContext*. 
This API accepts a *ClaimsPrincipal* which contains claims that describe the user. 
IdentityServer requires a special claim called *sub* whose value uniquely identifies the user.
On your login page, this would be the code to establish the authentication session and issue the cookie:

```csharp
var claims = new Claim[] {
    new Claim("sub", "unique_id_for_your_user")
};
var identity = new ClaimsIdentity(claims, "pwd");
var user = new ClaimsPrincipal(identity);

await HttpContext.SignInAsync(user);
```

{{% notice note %}}
The *sub* claim is the [subject identifier](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims) and is the most important claim your IdentityServer will issue.
It will uniquely identify the user and must never change and must never be reassigned to a different user.
A GUID data type is a very common choice for the *sub*. 
{{% /notice %}}

Additional claims can be added to the cookie if desired or needed at at other UI pages.
For example, it's common to also issue a *name* claim which represents the user's display name.

The claims issued in the cookie are passed as the *Subject* on the [ProfileDataRequestContext]({{<ref "/reference/profile_service#duendeidentityservermodelsprofiledatarequestcontext">}}) in the [profile service]({{<ref "/fundamentals/claims">}}).


## Well Known Claims Issued From the Login Page

There are some claims beyond *sub* that can be issued by your login page to capture additional information about the user's authentication session.
Internally Duende IdentityServer will set these values if you do not specify them when calling *SignInAsync*.
The claims are:

* ***name***: The display name of the user.
* ***amr***: Name of the [authentication method](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8176) used for user authentication (defaults to *pwd*).
* ***auth_time***: Time in epoch format the user entered their credentials (defaults to the current time).
* ***idp***: Authentication scheme name of the external identity provider used for login. When not specified then the value defaults to *local* indicating that it was a local login.

While you can create the *ClaimsPrincipal* yourself, you can alternatively use IdentityServer extension methods and the *IdentityServerUser* class to make this easier:

```cs
var user = new IdentityServerUser("unique_id_for_your_user")
{
    DisplayName = user.Username
};

await HttpContext.SignInAsync(user);
```

## The Return URL and the Login Workflow

Once the user has been logged in, they must complete the protocol workflow so they can ultimately be logged into the client.
To facilitate this, the login page is passed a *returnUrl* query parameter which refers to the URL the prior request came from.
This URL is, in essence, the same authorization endpoint to which the client made the original authorize request.

In the request to your login page where it logs the user in with a call to *SignInAsync*, it would then simply use the *returnUrl* to redirect the response back.
This will cause the browser to re-issue the original authorize request from the client allowing your IdentityServer to complete the protocol work.
An example of this redirect can be seen in the [local login]({{<ref "./local">}}) topic.

{{% notice note %}}
Beware [open-redirect attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_redirection#Security_issues) via the *returnUrl* parameter. You should validate that the *returnUrl* refers to well-known location.
Either use the *Url.IsLocalUrl* helper from ASP.NET Core, or use the [interaction service]({{< ref "/reference/interaction_service#iidentityserverinteractionservice-apis" >}}) from Duende IdentityServer for APIs to validate the *returnUrl* parameter.
{{% /notice %}}

Keep in mind that this *returnUrl* is state that needs to be maintained during the user's login workflow.
If your workflow involves page post-backs, redirecting the user to an external login provider, or just sending the user through a custom workflow, then this value must be preserved across all of those page transitions.

## Authorization Context

The *returnUrl* refers to the IdentityServer authorization endpoint and contains the original request parameters sent from the client.
These parameters might contain information your login page needs to customize its workflow.
Some examples would be for branding, dynamic page customization (e.g. which external login providers to use), or controlling what credentials the client application expects (e.g. perhaps MFA is required).

The [interaction service]({{< ref "/reference/interaction_service#iidentityserverinteractionservice-apis" >}}) provides a *GetAuthorizationContextAsync* API that will extract that information from the *returnUrl*.
The returned *AuthorizationRequest* object contains these values in its properties.

{{% notice note %}}
It is unnecessary (and discouraged) for your login page logic to parse the *returnUrl* itself.

## Cookie Handler Configuration

Duende IdentityServer registers a cookie authentication handler by default for the authentication session. 
The scheme that the handler in the authentication system is identified by is from the constant *IdentityServerConstants.DefaultCookieAuthenticationScheme*.

When configuring IdentityServer, the [AuthenticationOptions]({{<ref "/reference/options#Authentication">}}) expose some settings to control the cookie (e.g. expiration and sliding). For example:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddIdentityServer(options =>
    {
        options.Authentication.CookieLifetime = TimeSpan.FromHours(1);
        options.Authentication.CookieSlidingExpiration = false;
    });
}
```

{{% notice note %}}
In addition to the authentication cookie, IdentityServer will issue an additional cookie which defaults to the name *idsrv.session*. This cookie is derived from the main authentication cookie, and it used for the check session endpoint for [browser-based JavaScript clients at signout time]({{<ref "/authentication/ui/logout/notification#browser-based-javascript-clients">}}). It is kept in sync with the authentication cookie, and is removed when the user signs out.
{{% /notice %}}

If you require more control over the cookie authentication handler you can register your own cookie handler.
You can then configure IdentityServer to use your cookie handler by setting the *CookieAuthenticationScheme* on the [AuthenticationOptions]({{<ref "/reference/options#Authentication">}}). For example:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddAuthentication()
        .AddCookie("your_cookie", options => { 
            // ...
        });

    services.AddIdentityServer(options =>
    {
        options.Authentication.CookieAuthenticationScheme = "your_cookie";
    });
}
```

If the *CookieAuthenticationScheme* is not set, the cookie handler marked as the *DefaultAuthenticateScheme* configured for the ASP.NET Core application when using *AddAuthentication* will be the one used. So a scheme registered as the default after the call to *AddIdentityServer* in your startup will be the one used. For example:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddIdentityServer();

    services.AddAuthentication(defaultScheme: "your_cookie")
        .AddCookie("your_cookie", options => { 
            // ...
        });
}
```
