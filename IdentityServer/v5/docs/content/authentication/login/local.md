## Login User Interface and Identity Management System
One of the key features of Duende IdentityServer is that you have full control over the login UI, login workflow and the datasources you need to connect to.

We provide a full featured UI that you can use as a starting point to customize and connect to your own data stores in the quickstart UI [repo](https://github.com/DuendeSoftware/IdentityServer.Quickstart.UI). A popular option for greenfield scenarios is using Microsoft's ASP.NET Identity library for user management (TODO link to integration docs).
